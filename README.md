## What is this about?

This GitHub repository primarily serves internal purposes. However, you may find some publicly accessible scripts that I'm willing to share. Please note that these scripts may not be suitable for your specific needs as they could be still under development. My commitment to maintaining them is based on a personal approach: "If it stops working for me, I will update it."

Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository. My goal is to provide valuable knowledge and share useful resources that can benefit you in your endeavors.

## Can I contribute?

Absolutely! As I continue to learn, I welcome your contributions to this repository. You can contribute by suggesting code improvements, providing bug fixes, or making any other valuable suggestions. Please keep in mind that any contributions will be acknowledged as a collaborative effort, resulting in a shared outcome: "I made this, with significant contributions from others."

## Support?

While these scripts may not be intended for comprehensive support, I encourage you to open a new issue if you have any questions. If I have the knowledge to assist, I will gladly share it. Please note that support pertains to the resources shared within this repository, rather than the 1MB server.

## Server IP (Can I play?)

If you wish to play, please understand we're a family-friendly survival server, we do not tolerate abuse, /rules breaking, etc.
