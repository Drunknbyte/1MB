Things for the 1MoreBlock.com Minecraft survival server

## What is this about?

This repository is mainly for internal use. Some public scripts I don't mind sharing will end up here. But they might not work for you. They might still be in development, and progress is limited to "if it stops working for me, I will update it".

Thank you for checking out this repository. I hope what I learn and share is useful to you.

## Can I contribute?

Sure, I am still learning everything, feel free to show me how. Contribute through code suggestions, improvements, bug fixes, etc. Just please know the end result will be like: "I made this, most of it, and with contributions of others". 

## Support?

If you require support, maybe these scripts aren't for you. But, you're always free to open a new issue and if I know the answer I will share it. Support is not for the 1MB server, but for the resources I share on this repository. 

## Server IP (Can I play?)

If you wish to play, please understand we're a family friendly survival server, we do not tolerate abuse, /rules breaking, etc. 

`1moreblock.com:25565` (Currently Java Edition: 1.16.5)
