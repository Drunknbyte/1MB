# Permissions
- A player is allowed to have multiple angelchests, and they have a period of time to find their angelchests and right-click them to collect their information. 
- Other players are not allowed to take the items from these chests. 
- Once an angelchest has expired it will drop the items on the floor at which point those items are 'fair game', though we request players to be nice human beings and consider returning the items.
