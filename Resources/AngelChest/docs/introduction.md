# 1MB /angelchest feature

Thread is a WIP as this feature is fairly new. If you believe some information is missing feel free to reach out to staff.

Players will soon be able to die and have their items stored in an angelchest, this currently is a chest with a hologram above it, but,this design might change over time. 

Players will have 10 minutes to find their chest, the last one, of course, being at /dback, after which the chest expires, and the items drop on the floor. 

Players can have multiple angel chests. Each with their own expiry timer.

More info at /angelchest, which also opens the GUI where players can see the xyz locations and see the timers. 

Right now during testing, it's 'free' to unlock a chest, it will soon cost either money or a special item. 

We're still setting up the plugin, settings and behavior might change.
