# Complete Challenges for UUID

> A simple shell script to help parse and process data from a player's `<uuid>.json` file after resetting and re-importing the default library in BentoBox. This script was created as a quick solution to address issues encountered during a hotfix. While not a Java-based solution, it effectively completes the task.

## BentoBox Add-on: Challenges Completer

- **Compatibility:** BentoBox 2.3.0 for Minecraft 1.20.4.
- **Add-on:** Challenges, version 1.3.0, compatible with any gametype add-on.
- **Note:** This script was designed for a specific edge-case. Use it only if you fully understand its purpose and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Your server must be running and managed through `tmux`, or you will need to modify the script to suit your setup.
- The script requires `jq` (a command-line JSON processor). If `jq` is not installed, the script will provide instructions for installation.

## Installation

1. Download the `1MB-Challenges-Fix.sh` script and place it in the directory:  
   `~/plugins/BentoBox/database/ChallengesPlayerData`
2. Make the script executable:  
   ```
   chmod a+x 1MB-Challenges-Fix.sh
   ```
3. Ensure your server is running in a `tmux` session. The default session name is `mcserver`.
4. Edit the `.sh` script to include the player's Minecraft UUID.
5. Run the script:  
   ```
   ./1MB-Challenges-Fix.sh
   ```

## How It Works

- The script scans the player's JSON file for completed challenges, logging these into a `.log` file while removing duplicates.
- It then processes the log file line by line, with a 3-second delay between commands, feeding each line as a BentoBox console command to the `mcserver` tmux session. This ensures that challenges are marked as completed if they were not already registered.

## Bug Reports / Suggestions

- If you encounter any issues, feel free to open a ticket. I'll do my best to address bugs or update the script as needed.
- You're welcome to clone the repository, make improvements, and submit a pull request. I'll review and potentially merge your contributions.
