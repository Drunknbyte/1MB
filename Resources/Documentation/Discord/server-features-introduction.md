# <:1MoreBlock:853860327012040704> Server Features / Documentation ‚ÑπÔ∏è

### The server is split in a few ways.

## üó∫Ô∏è Worlds

We have the general survival worlds like `/general` and `/wild`, along with `/end` and `/nether`. The inventories are shared between these worlds.

Then we have the game-type worlds like `/oneblock` and `/skyblock`. These do not have a nether or end dimension, and their inventories do not share with other worlds.

We also have a few special worlds, such as the original `/legacy`, the game world `/run`, and of course, our first-spawn `/spawn` world.

There's also the creative-mode `/builders` world. Additionally, our `/events` are their own separate worlds with their own set of features.

## <:beacon:888654532001792041> Features

We have four sets of features on the server. They help us run the server, assist players in their adventures, and offer some fun extra features.

First, we have server management features. Next, we have world protection features. Then, we have player features. Finally, we have a set of features for events, mini-games, etc.

## <:blob_love_diamonds_minecraft:1032691218146144418> Support

Our documentation will focus on the player features as they are the most frequently asked questions.
