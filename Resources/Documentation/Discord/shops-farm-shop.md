The pyro farming plugin has a way to sell the farm items you have collected. You can't sell them normally through /sell, so use /farm shop!

Farming is a great way to earn a lot of money. Each item can come from a different tier.  Their value goes up based on the tier.

Put the items in /farm shop's gui, and press escape, it will sell them.

The money goes to your global /balance.

This should work in almost all the worlds.
