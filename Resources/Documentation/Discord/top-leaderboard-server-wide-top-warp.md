This is a work in progress, but we hope to offer a global warp where you can visit an area with a lot of holograms and scoreboards displaying leaderboards from various features.

This will likely become: /warp top, or something along those lines. 

If you have suggestions for top leaderboard holograms or signs, please post them here. 

We're thinking jobs, mcmmo, fishing, farming, points, and many more. What are you thinking of?
