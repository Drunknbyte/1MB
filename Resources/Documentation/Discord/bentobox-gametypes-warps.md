Players can not teleport to each other, sorry.

A player has to have an island level higher than 10 (/oneblock level for example) which allows them to place a sign that creates a warp.

The first line of the sign has to say: `[welcome]`

Once placed successfully and the island level is over 10, others can type for example: /oneblock warp mrfloris
