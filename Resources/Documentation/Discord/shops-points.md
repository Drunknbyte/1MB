The welcomes points plugin allows players to earn points through various ways, which can then be used in the /points shop to buy interesting items or features. 

/points
will open the menu, from where you can pick the type of shop. 
This shop works in all survival worlds, not in the game type worlds. 

Each time you welcome someone without reasonable time of joining, by their full minecraft name, you get a couple of points.
You also get points on the daily, if you vote each day.
You can also earn points by eating fish you catch that are called "pointy fish"
And you can participate in events, sometimes there are unique items dropped that give you points.

We used to have jobs points as well, but we're phasing that out. We will soon make it impossible to earn new jobs points. Existing jobs points will soon be able to get converetd to /points points..
