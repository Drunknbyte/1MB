These are global rules, but it is possible one or more game-types have a setting to override (as an exception; Report this if you spot it)

Globally:
- Mobs do not cause block damage, this includes, ravager, ender dragon, wither, charged creeper, etc.
- Mobs do cause player damage, you can indeed die from mobs. 
- Endermen do not steal your blocks. 
- Zombies can steal your items and/or blocks when they're on the floor.
- Mobs can damage other mobs too.
- Mobs die in a fire, and can get struck by lightning which will damage them.
