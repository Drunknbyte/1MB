The global /market is a player-market. Every player can have one or more listings of the items they want to sell to other players.

You don't have to be online to sell the listed items. The plugin will take care of it.

Hold the item in your hand and type /market sell number, or /ah sell number

For example, you're holding 64 stone, and you type: /ah sell 5, it will then take the stone, list it on the market for 5, if someone buys it you get the money and they get the 64 stone. 

You can also use /trade to directly trade (even for money) with another player. Or use /sell to sell the items. But in the global market you can define your own price, which might be nice. 

If you have items to sell on the regular, you could consider a ShopChest.
