There are three or four ways to use lava and water in the vanilla game mechanics to generate new items - this happens when they touch!

For example, lava on top of water, lava below water, lava against water, lava in the nether, etc.

For NOW, because we might change this at some point, we have only the mechanic that generates cobblestone. 

Please do not make a stone generator, most features will not work then. Make a COBBLESTONE generator.

Once done, type /<gametype> generator, and unlock the ones you can. 

You might have to increase your island level to get certain ones. 

The main cobblestone one will always be active, and then it's best to select one other generator, for example lush generator or diamond generator.

When you use redstone to manipulate blocks, it will not give mcMMO

If you use a natural game mechanic, it will.

When you do it right, you will see cobblestone changing to other blocks. 

The generator is a great way to speed upu item generation which helps you build up your island. And therefor your island level.
