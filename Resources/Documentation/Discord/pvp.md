PvP (player vs player) combat fighting is off by default. This is to prevent toxic players, item stealers, and drama.

Players are free to decide to turn on (and leave it on or turn it back off again) their pvp mode. 

To turn on pvp: /pvp on
To turn it off : /pvp off

Note that both players have to have /pvp on, in order for them to be able to fight eachother. 
Some protected regions might not allow pvp-ing, check with /here, perhaps /rtp first and pick a fight.
