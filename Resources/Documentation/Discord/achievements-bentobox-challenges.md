When you play /oneblock or /skyblock, or any of the game types, you can also complete challenges, for example: /oneblock challenges, or /skyblock challenges.

These challenges offer a variety of ways to complete them, for example by holding certain items or blocks in your inventory that you have to collect first. Or standing in a field of farm land with certain crops around you. To collecting a bunch of mobs. You get some reward items for completing these challenges. 

With enough challenges completed, you can go from one tier to another, I think there's a handful of them.
