It's possible that randomly global boosters turn on and off, sometimes without a heads-up notice. We usually do not disclose how long they last either.

Players can type: /rate

This currently shows the mcMMO booster, not the jobs one (pout, maybe one day)

Let's get OneMoreBlock poppin'! Invite your friends to join. Once we hit 20 players, mrFloris might just turn on those BOOSTERS! <:blob_love_diamonds_minecraft:1032691218146144418>
