# How to level up?
You can not gain salvage levels directly instead you will gain salvage level depending on the average level of the 2 parent skills (Repair & Fishing)

# How to use Salvage
Place down a mcmmo salvage anvil (a gold block) and right click to salvage the item you're currently holding. This will break apart the item, and give back materials used to craft the item. 

For example, salvaging an iron pickaxe will give you iron ingots.

# Advanced Salvage
When unlocked, this ability allows you to salvage damaged items. The yield percentage increases as you level up. A higher yield means that you get more materials back. With advanced salvage you will always get 1 material back, unless the item is too damaged. Sop you don't have to worry about destroying items without getting anything in return.

# Arcane Salvage
This ability allows you to get enchanted books when salvaging enchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of successfully extracting a hull or partial enchantment varies.

When an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment book will have a lower level enchantment compared to what it was on the item.
