# How to get started?
Just grab any type of fishing rod and start fishing you can view all menus using `/fish menu` 

# Entrophy
Entrophy is the special currentcy of PyroFishing. This can be used in varius places within the plugin like for example to craft `Augments`

# Custom fish
When fishing you will find custom fish these custom fish are divided into 6 rarity tiers. These can also be viewed in `/fish codex`

- Mythical

Custom fish have a couple different uses. They can be sold in `/fish shop` or used in `/fish deliveries` some fish also have special effects when you eat them.

# Deliveries
Fish deliveries give you special rare items and entrophy. Every 180 custom fish you catch you get 1 delivery (it will tell you in chat that you have gained a delivery). To start the delivery open the menu using `/fish deliveries` gather the fish required then click on the piece of paper to start the delivery.

There are 4 delivery tiers 
- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Mythical

At the bottom of the `/fish deliveries` menu you can upgrade your delivery stats using entrpohy.

# Scales
You can weigh your custom fish in `/fish scales`. This will have a chance to make them worth more `/balance` when sold in `/fish shop`. Just put your fish into the menu and select a risk tier when ready click the anvil to weigh your fish!

# Fish Bag
The fish bag allows you to store fish you can access it using `/fish bag`. This can be quite useful when fishing far away from your base

# Gutting
You can gut fish for entrophy and items just place your fish in `/fish gut` then click the nether star to gut the fish.

# Fish levels and skills
You level up automatically just by fishing you can see your current level in `/fish stats`. Each level will grand you 1 skill point you can use the skill points in `/fish skills`. The top row of skills can be upgraded a unlimited amount of times while the bottom row of skills are a 1 time purchase.

# Totem
When you have buid the totem structure shown in `/fish menu`(click on the totem of undying). Once build right click the bottom obverver with your fishing rod. You will then be required to gather items to activate the totem. You need to be `/fish stats` level 20 to activate your totem. Once activated you can access the totem menu by right clicking the bottom obverser this is where you can upgrade and activate your totem.

# Augments
Augments are essentially custom enchantments for your fishing rod. you can view the list of different augments and the required items in `/fish augments`. When you have gathered the required items and have enough entrophy trow the items in a cauldron and hit the cauldron with your fishing rod. You now have an augment to apply it to your fishing rod open `/fish augment` put in both your fishing rod and the augment and click confirm augment

You can **not** use custom items in the making of augments (ofcourse custom pyro fishing items are allowed) if you have the required items but it gives you an error check if the vanilla items needed might be custom.

# Crabs
Crabs sometimes spawn when fishing they are silverfish with the name "Crab" when killed they can drop crab scales & crab claws these items are used to craft augments
