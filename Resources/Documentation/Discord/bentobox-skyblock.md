You type /skyblock to generate your island, you can return to your island by typing /skyblock again.

This island is a bunch of very specifically picked out blocks, breaking them is needed to generate new things. Repeat until you have enough to craft things, expand the island, complete challenges, build generators, and become the top island.

Hopefully in the future we can offer multiple islands.

Players can team up. See /teams
