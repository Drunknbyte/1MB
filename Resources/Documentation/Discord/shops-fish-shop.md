The pyro fishing plugin has a way to sell the fish you catch. You can't sell them normally through /sell, so use /fish shop!

Fishing is a great way to earn a lot of money. Each fish can come from a different tier, like bronze, or platinum. Their value goes up based on the tier.

Put the items in /fish shop's gui, and press escape, it will sell the fish.

The money goes to your global /balance.

This should work in almost all the worlds.
