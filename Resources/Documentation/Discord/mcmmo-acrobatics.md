# How to level up?
Acrobatics is the art of moving Gravefully in mcmmo. It provides combat bonuses and environment damage bonuses. To gain XP in this skill you need to perform a dodge in combat or survive falls from heights that damage you.

# Rolling
You have a passive chance when you take fall damage to negate the damage done. You can hold the sneak button to double your chances during the fall. This triggers a Graveful Roll instead of a standard one. Graceful Rolls are like regular rolls but are twice as likely to occus and provide more damage safety then regular rolls. Rolling chance is tied to your skill level.

# Dodge
Dodge is a passive chance when you are injured in combat to halve the damage token. It is tied to your skill level.
