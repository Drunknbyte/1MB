You can type /shop, this is a plugin that has some categories with items. You can buy from the admin shop - it has infinite stock. 

Maybe not all categories are public yet, and this only works in the survival worlds /end, /nether, /wild and /general.

The value of an items is 100x the value of the survival /worth 

So if a stone is $1 in /worth, to /sell
If you want to buy it, instead of mining it !! then it will be $100 for you to buy 1.
Keep an eye on the total price. 

You can buy 1 or multiple, or stack of 64, or many stacks of 64. Explore the buy menu

Items missing? Report it to us, and we will add it to our todo list.

Players can make ShopChests, or use /market (/ah) or even /trade, to buy/trade/sell items with other players, instead of using the admin shop. Or, ya know. Go mining !
