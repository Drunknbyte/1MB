Fishing is one of the most relaxing ways to have fun and make money on 1MB. To get started, you just need to make a fishing rod and go fishing! If you want to make more money as you fish, join the fisherman job in /jobs. You will automatically earn MCMMO and Pyrofishing xp as you fish. One of the great features we have for fishing is /fish bag. This allows you to store more fish before you need to start selling or gutting. You can use /fish menu or simply shift click on your fishing rod to get to the selling and gutting links. You will also fish up lots of cool loot, including fishing rods with enchantments which you can combine with your basic rod to improve it. The better your fishing rod, the better your fish! Fishing is a great help in /acid and /skyblock to help you obtain items which are otherwise difficult to get. There are lots of other features to be discussed, but for now, just go fish!
