Each time you die in most survival worlds, there is a chance that an angel will protect your items.

An angel chest will generate in a radius nearby your death location.

The chest will contain your items, instead of them being dropped.

If you have any soulbound items, they will not be included in the chest; they will remain with you as they are bound to your soul.

Any remaining experience points will also be in the chest.

The chest will have a 10-minute countdown.

The coordinates (x, y, z) of your angel chest will be printed in the chat. You can also type `/angelchestlist` to view the list.

After 10 minutes, the chest will disappear, dropping your items on the ground. The vanilla item-wipe timer will then start for the loaded chunk, and items will despawn under certain conditions.

In certain worlds, such as the game-type worlds oneblock, skyblock, etc., there are no angel chests.

Currently, collecting an angel chest is free (can someone test this?). We might charge a fee in the future.

Angel chests have a high spawn rate when you die in lava under certain conditions, but this is not guaranteed. Do not assume it will happen.

Angel chests do not spawn when you fall into the void, such as the /end void or any game-type voids.

If an angel chest spawns outside the world border, contact an in-game staff member as soon as possible. However, be aware that in most cases, neither you nor the staff can recover the items. Consider them lost (sorry).

Side note: When a player dies, the in-game chat will indicate that you can use /dback to return to your death location. If an angel chest has spawned, its location will be printed in the chat, within a radius around the death location. If you do not see it, explore the area.
