The pyro mining plugin has a way to sell the dropped items you have collected through mining deepslate ores. You can't sell them normally through /sell, so use /mine shop!

Mining is a great way to earn a lot of money. Each dropped item can come from a different tier.  Their value goes up based on the tier.

Put the items in /mine shop's gui, and press the sell icon at the bottom, it will sell them.

The money goes to your global /balance.

This should work in almost all the worlds.
