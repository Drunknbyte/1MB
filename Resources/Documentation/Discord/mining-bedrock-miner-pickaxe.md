Mining world border bedrock is not allowed. Even if there's a misconfiguration and your can break it with this pickaxe: We will take the bedrock away, restore what you've done, and potentially sanction your account depending on severity.

That said .. happy mining ..

Players are allowed to break bedrock that they have placed themselves, or when owners from a region ask others to help them break and move it. 

Players are not allowed to break bedrock that is placed by others, or in build areas of others. If it's not yours: our regular anti grief and no item stealing rules apply.

The goal of this special feature is to allow players that have legally obtained bedrock to place and fix their placed-mistakes. If a player uses bedrock to build and decides it needs to get moved: Great, we have a pickaxe for that.

This pickaxe is special. Only this pickaxe will work. And only 1MB Bedrock bedrock-item blocks will drop. Which can be used to mine another special bedrock-miner pickaxe again.

You can not craft the special pickaxe, you cannot craft the special bedrock. 

You can only craft the special pickaxe using the special bedrock.

The pick is special, it will break fast. Be mindful when using. 

Again, it's meant to help players fix accidentally or incorrectly placed bedrock that they own. Assume the rest isn't welcome, nor allowed to do.

In-game type /bedrock, you can currently buy the special bedrock via /jobs shop, it will soon be sold via /shop -> survival -> special 1MB tools/items.

This is a silk touch 5 pickaxe, be careful not to break it. We will not help restore it.

You can not salvage this to get a silk touch 5 book to then add that to another pickaxe, it will end up as a regular pickaxe with silk touch 1. We will not help restore this mistake if you make it.
