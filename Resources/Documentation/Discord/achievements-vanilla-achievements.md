Players can get vanilla achievements, now called 'advancements', made by Mojang. 

Due to the set-up of our Minecraft server it's not possible in certain worlds to get certain ones, players can then type: /impossible, which will sync-up and grant you the impossible ones.

If you believe it's impossible to get a certain advancement in a certain world, please open a ticket and report it. We will investigate and possibly add it to the /impossible command.

Besides vanilla advancements, it's possible to get additional achievements for doing certain tasks. If you have completed them all, check back a while later, we might have added one or more in since the last time you've checked (/achievements).

It's also possible that certain commands announce milestones as an advancement or achievement.
