# How to level up?
With the axes skill you can use your axe for much more then just deforesting! You can hack and chop away at mobs and players to gain XP, hitting mobs with the effect of knockback and inflicting deadly criticals on mobs and players. Your axe also becomes a hand held woodchipper, breaking down the enemy's armor with ease as your level increases.

To gain XP in this skill you need to hit other mobs or players with an axe.

# Skull Splitter
This ability allows you to deal an AoE (Area of Effect) hit. this AoE hit will deal half as much damage as you did to the main target, so it's great for clearing out large piles of mobs.

# Critical Strikes
Critical strikes is a passive ability which gives players a chance to deal additional damage. With the default settings, every 2 skill levels in axes awards a 0.1% chance to deal a critical strike, causing 2.0 times damage.

# Axe Mastery 
Axe mastery is a passive ability that will add additional damage to your hits when using axes. By default, the bonus increases by 1 every 50 levels, up to a cap of 4 extra damage at level 200.

# Armor Impact
Strike with enough force to shatter armor! Armor impact has a passive chance to damage your opponent's armor. This damage increases as you level in axes.

# Greater Impact 
You have a passive chance to achieve a greater impact when hitting mobs or players with your axe. By default this chance is 25%. this passive ability has an extreme knockback effect, similar to the knockback 2 enchantment. In addition, it deals bonus damage to the target.
