Each game type, like /oneblock and /skyblock have a top island feature. You can check who expanded and build on their island the most. 

/oneblock top
/skyblock top
/cave top
/acid top
/skygrid top

The GUI will list the top 10 island owners, clicking their head shoud usually teleport you to their island (if they have a welcome-sign warp)
