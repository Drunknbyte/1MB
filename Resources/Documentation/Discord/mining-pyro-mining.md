But basically: mine deepslate ores to see what they sometimes drop, and you can use that in /mine

# Vessels
Custom Enchantments for pickaxes

A complex system that allows players to craft and use custom enchantments on their pickaxes only. This system is used in conjunction with the new Artifacts and Fossils system. This alone will give your players 300 to 400 hours worth of content to just max their pickaxes. These come with boss fights, thralls and requiums!

# pro tip

If you are mining, keep an eye on the items that drop, they might be special pyro mining items. Which as per the info above, you can use to benefit your gameplay.

There is official documentation, but it's very unclear if this is for version 4.5 or 5 or 3.1 .. it might be incomplete, outdated, or stuff for the future, i really can't tell. https://pyrotempus.gitbook.io/pyro-plugins/pyromining/features/vessels

# SILK TOUCH
you can silk touch deepslate ore, and place it later, and then mine it without silk touch .. 
if you want instant /mine stats 'exp' then dont use silk touch, or make sure to place the ores down later






# How to get started?
Using a **fortune** pickaxe just mine any deepslate ore and you will gain pyro mining xp, zeta and items. All PyroMining commands can be used via `/mine menu`

# Fluxes
Fluxes can be found from mining ores
- basic fluxes will drop from overworld ores.
- blazed fluxes will drop from nether ores.

Fluxes can be sold to `/mine shop` for `/balance` money.

# Gemstones
Gemstones drop from each ore apart from Gold and Iron ore. You can either sell them using `/mine shop` or right click them to identify their quality which can either increase or decrease the overall sell price of the gemstone.

Gemstones have a 5 different qualities to them which can increase or decrease the price you can sell them for. To check their quality right click the gemstone in your hand and it will show you its quality. The qualities that are possible are listed below.

- Ruined
- Badly damaged
- Damaged
- Worn
- Pristine

# Refinery
A refinery is needed to process `Mysterious Dust`. To create a refinery place a Dropper facing upwards and a fence post ontop of it.

Place the `Mysterious Dust` inside the refinery and punch the fence post to process the `Mysterious Dust` into the following components.

- Rune dust (used to spawn rune guardians)
- Orcalite (used to spawn oracles)
- Ancient relic (used to upgrade sealed artifacts)
- Shattered requium orb (can be crafted into requium orbs)

Alternatively, you can place all 8 pieces of a vessel in it and punch the fence post to craft a vessel!

# Rune Dust
Gained from Refining `Mysterious Dust` in a Refinery. Used to summon Rune Guardians to earn runes.(`Mysterious Dust` is found from just mining deepslate ores.)

# Runes/Rune Guardians
Runes are obtained by killing rune guardians. Rune Guardians are mini-bosses that can be summoned using `Rune Dust` which is obtained from `Mysterious Dust`.

To summon a Rune Guardian, click on a Redstone Ore with `Rune Dust` and it will open a menu, Once the menu pops up you have the option to choose which guardian you would like to spawn. There is a cooldown between spawning guardians!

Runes are needed to upgrade and level up your `/mine singularity`.

# Zeta
Zeta is the custom currency used in PyroMining. Zeta is used to upgrade passives and remove vessels from pickaxes, it is also used for creating vessels in a refinery!

Zeta can be obtained when mining from breaking ores. The better quality ore you break, the more Zeta you will earn.

For now we will focus on DEEPSLATE ores, not regular ones.

# Oracles
Oracles can be summoned using Charged Oracleite. To obtain this, Refine some `Mysterious Dust` to get Uncharged Oracleite. Then mine the appropriate amount of Deepslate Diamond Ore that it specifies and right click on Deepslate Emerald ore to summon the boss. Please note that these bosses should most likely be fought with end-game gear and with friends if possible.

# Artifacts and Fossils
Artifacts drop from breaking ores. They drop various loot, including ores and Fossils. Once they're identified you will recieve various drops. You can up your artifact tier by using an ancient relic on a sealed artifact.

There are 9 rarity tiers.
- Basic
- Unusual
- Epic
- Exceptional
- Legendary
- Fabled
- Mythic
- Celestial
- Divine

In order to identify an artifact you need to right click the sealed artifact you received from mining. This needs to be done in order to place it in one of the slots in `/mine artifacts`. Here you will place one artifact into a slot so it can be identified. Now you need to wait for it to be ready.

Once your artidact is done being identified you can click on the ender chest to claim your reward!

# Vessels
Vessels are essentially custom enchantments for pickaxes. To craft a vessel you need all 8 pieces of the vessel which can be obtained as fossils from artifacts. You need to place all 8 pieces of a vessel into a refinery and punch the fence post to create it. Vessels require you to guess the correct requium order to be able to kill the boss to officially add the vessel to your pickaxe! You are able to view your previous requium attempts inside of the /mine vessels menu.

Each vessel has unique abilities reflecting its element type. The more vessels you add to your pickaxe the stronger the next level of the vessel will be. To level up a vessel simply add the same vessel to the same pickaxe (quirk doesn't matter) Once you have completed the vessel it will level that certain vessel up on your pickaxe.

# Requiums
Three of these are needed in the correct order to defeat and damage the vessel boss. You can randomly guess and try to find out the correct order or you can kill thralls. Killing thralls will give you progress to unlocking the correct requium needed for that slot. Once you obtain 100% in a certain slot it will tell you the correct requium to use. You can view your previous requium attempts for that vessel in /mine vessels and selecting the (previous attempts book). You obtain requiums from artifacts!

# Thralls
Thralls are little creatures that spawn when mining certain ores. Killing these will give you anger progress and progress towards unlocking the correct requiums. There is a 2 minute cooldown between finding thralls.
