But basically: mine deepslate ores to see what they sometimes drop, and you can use that in /mine

# Fluxes
Orbs you can find when mining certain ores which can then be sold to a mining market.

Fluxes can be found when mining specific ores. There are currently six different tiers of fluxes. Ranging from Common to Exotic and Hellstone.

# Gemstones
These Gemstones will have more features in the future. They can currently be sold to the mining market as well.

Gemstones currently have two uses. One of these uses is being sold to the mine market for money. Gemstones can also be used when purchasing augments. (See below). Gemstones also have a "quality" to them. Meaning you can get different qualities which influx the prices depending on the values in the configuration file. The quality tiers include:
Ruined;
Badly Damaged;
Damaged;
Worn;
Pristine.

# Rune Dust
Gained from Refining 'Mysterious Dust' in a Refinery. Used to summon Rune Guardians to earn runes.

# Refinery
A multi-block structure that allows you to grind Mysterious Dust down into other useful items. See the spoiler on how to make one.

# Runes
You get these from killing Rune Guardians. You summon these with Rune Dust by clicking on Deepslate Redstone Ore. Runes are like a custom currency and used to unlock things / use items.

# Zeta / Ethera 
This is the custom currency for mining. You can get Zeta (or Ethera) from breaking ores when mining.

Zeta can be obtained when mining from breaking ores. The better quality ore you break, the more Zeta you will earn.

For now we will focus on DEEPSLATE ores, not regular ones.

# Singularity
Kill Rune Guardians to harness their power and upgrade skills to aid you on your journey throughout PyroMining.

# Vessels
Custom Enchantments for pickaxes

A complex system that allows players to craft and use custom enchantments on their pickaxes only. This system is used in conjunction with the new Artifacts and Fossils system. This alone will give your players 300 to 400 hours worth of content to just max their pickaxes. These come with boss fights, thralls and requiums!

# Artifacts and Fossils
Unique drop tables that rewards players for mining.

The newest addition. These drop randomly from mining any block. You can obtain rare loot from these in the plugin and in vanilla minecraft such as diamonds, emeralds and pre-silked ores. These are used to also obtain Fossils that can be used to craft Vessels.

# Mining Level & Skill Tree
This is used to spend skill points on perks, such as increasing your Zeta gain.

You can earn XP towards your mining level by breaking ores as well.
Skill points will be used to increase perks in the plugin.

# Oracles
Oracles can be summoned using Charged Oracleite. To obtain this, Refine some Mysterious Dust to get Uncharged Oracleite. Then mine the appropriate amount of Diamond Ore that it specifies and right click on Emerald ore to summon the boss. Please note that these bosses should most likely be fought with end-game gear and with friends if possible.

# pro tip

If you are mining, keep an eye on the items that drop, they might be special pyro mining items. Which as per the info above, you can use to benefit your gameplay.

There is official documentation, but it's very unclear if this is for version 4.5 or 5 or 3.1 .. it might be incomplete, outdated, or stuff for the future, i really can't tell. https://pyrotempus.gitbook.io/pyro-plugins/pyromining/features/vessels

In the nether you can also mine nether quartz ore

# SILK TOUCH
you can silk touch deepslate ore, and place it later, and then mine it without silk touch .. 
if you want instant /mine stats 'exp' then dont use silk touch, or make sure to place the ores down later






`/mine menu`

## How to get started?
Using a **fortune** pickaxe just mine any deepslate ore and you will gain pyro mining xp, zeta and items.

### Fluxes
Fluxes can be found from mining ores
- basic fluxes will drop from overworld ores.
- blazed fluxes will drop from nether ores.

Fluxes can be sold to `/mine shop` for `/balance` money.

### Gemstones
Gemstones drop from each ore apart from Gold and Iron ore. You can either sell them using `/mine shop` or right click them to identify their quality which can either increase or decrease the overall sell price of the gemstone.

Gemstones have a 5 different qualities to them which can increase or decrease the price you can sell them for. To check their quality right click the gemstone in your hand and it will show you its quality. The qualities that are possible are listed below.

- Ruined
- Badly damaged

- Pristine

### Refinery
A refinery is needed to process `Mysterious Dust`. To create a refinery place a Dropper facing upwards and a fence post ontop of it.

Place the `Mysterious Dust` inside the refinery and punch the fence post to process the `Mysterious Dust` into the following components.

- Rune dust (used to spawn rune guardians)
- Orcalite (used to spawn oracles)
- Ancient relic (used to upgrade sealed artifacts)
- Shattered requium orb (can be crafted into requium orbs)

Alternatively, you can place all 8 pieces of a vessel in it and punch the fence post to craft a vessel!
