Almost all items you gather through crafting, mining, trading, etc. can be sold if they have a value assigned to them.

You can hold the item and type : /worth
This will tell you the value. 

Type: /sell
and a gui opens, put the items in there which have a value, and press escape. It will then sell them.

This only works in the survival worlds, which are /general, /wild, /end and /nether at the moment.
