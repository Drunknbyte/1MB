## Fishing Warp
Some fisherman love to be left alone, others love to team up. Besides earning an mcMMO fishing exp bonus if you are in the same mcMMO /party (and close to eachother) you also enjoy PFP Party fishing bonus. Team up with a stranger or friends, you can do this anywhere of course, but you're free to invite others to join you for some fishing at `/warp fish`

At `/warp fish` players can fish from docks, in various spots, explore and enjoy the fun environment on this island and everything in the sea. As well as go down a floor where there are enchantments and other things being sold related to fishing. 

Warp fish is all about community!
