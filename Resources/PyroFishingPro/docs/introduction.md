# 1MB Custom Fish Features

This information relates to the plugin PyroFishingPro and does not cover the also existing /jobs fisherman job, nor the mcMMO `/fishing` skill.

The vanilla fishing can be quite boring, so we've changed that. Not only are there more fish in the game now, the custom fish can all do things. One might fix your hunger, the other might heal you, a third one might give you some /points.

## How to get started?
Well, the simplest thing is: Just fish! And explore the `/fish menu`.

All the below information will try to go through these fishing features to help you get introduced to a fun and custom fishing experience on 1MB. If at any time you have any questions, feel free to reach out to a team member. I happen to know that JackPerByte, Tidala, and kgrim1 all are quite familiar with fishing.

## Menu
- If you hold your fishing rod, you can sneak and right-click to open the fish menu.
- You can also type `/fish menu` to get to that same menu.

This menu will give you an overview of the various features the custom fishing on 1MoreBlock.com offers. You can review your fishing rod, your personal stats, open the fish shop, check the deliveries, review the fish codex, take a chance in the scales menu, open and manage your fish bag, use the gutting station, manage your fishing skills, buy bait (when available) from the bait store, manage augments, and learn more about the totem.
