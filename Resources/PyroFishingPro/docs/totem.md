## Totems and Unique Effects
Craft Totems that offer distinctive effects, passives, and special occurrences.

The Totem's passive effects work in the radius and 30 blocks above and 30 blocks below the particles.

You can ask other fishers on the 1MB server to see their totem to learn how to build one.

In `/fish menu` you can click on `Totem` item.
