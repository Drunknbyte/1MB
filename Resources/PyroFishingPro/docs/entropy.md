## Entropy
- Entropy is the 'currency' of the 1MB Fisherman!
- There's a command: `/fish entropy`.
- You can get entropy with `/fish gut`.

You can get entropy by fishing, completing deliveries, or just gutting the special fish. The Entropy also required for crafting an augment or improving deliveries.

You can store your entropy in an item; just do `/fish augment`, then click the `paper icon`, you will get one entropy crystal for every click that you do. That stores 10k of entropy in each crystal. You can sell, trade, or just store those. 50k will get you access to the hotspot.
