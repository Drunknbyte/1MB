## Custom Items
You can kill some aquatic animals to get special fishing items.
- Dolphin tails come from dolphins; they look like enchanted rabbit feet. Killing a dolphin gives you a chance at getting one.
- Crab parts come from fishing up crabs, which is kind of rare. As such, I suggest the crab bait augment first.
