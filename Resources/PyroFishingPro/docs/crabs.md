## Crabs and Anti-AFK Mechanisms
You will encounter Crabs! They deter AFK-Fishing and drop items useful for crafting augments. Yes, on our 1MoreBlock.com server, we do not allow automation. This includes anti-afking, as well as auto-fishing. We do not allow it. You have to earn what you want.

The plugin discourages AFK-Fishing and checks for common fishing machines, promoting fair gameplay. And the staff will take action if they suspect a player from participating in unfair gameplay.

- Crab parts come from fishing up crabs, which is kind of rare. As such, I suggest the crab bait augment first.
