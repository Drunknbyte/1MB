## Sell Shop and Economy
You cannot sell fish of any type through the global `/sell` feature, only through the custom fish shop. However, you can share, trade, and sell your fish between other players. Team up and level up faster!

Sell fish for in-game currency at the `/fish shop`, adding an economic aspect to your Minecraft experience.

Note that we mentioned earlier that we have a variety of custom fish, from low to higher tier, and even mythical fish. On top of that, we have custom 1MB fish such as EPIC player fish with special commands, as well as Pointy fish. Be careful which fish you sell to the fish shop. You might want to keep certain fish for certain commands, deliveries, etc.
