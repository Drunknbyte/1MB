## Bait System
In 2023, we do not require bait to be obtained to catch certain fish.

In 2024, we're going to gradually introduce the bait system for certain fish.

You can acquire custom baits from an in-game shop to attract rare and unique fish that you can only catch if you have fish bait.

Buying baits will cost money, and they have a limited number of uses. You can check the `/fish codex` to see which fish require what bait.
