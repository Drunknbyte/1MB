## Bait System

In 2024, the plan is to gradually introduce the bait system for certain fish.

You can acquire custom baits from an in-game shop '/fish bait' to attract rare and unique fish that you can only catch if you have fish bait.

Buying baits will cost money, and they have a limited number of uses. You can check the `/fish codex` to see which fish require what bait.

To use the purchased bait, drag and drop onto your fishing rod. 

Note: bait does not increase the odds or frequency of catching a fish. If a fish type is configured to use bait, then bait MUST be used in order to catch that fish.
