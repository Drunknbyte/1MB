## Tournaments
Sometimes we have short or longer fishing tournaments. Some are announced ahead of time during special server events, others spontaneously happen throughout the month. We also have a weekly tournament on set days and times. Ask around in-game or on our Discord if other players have figured out yet which days and times.

Tournaments when activated announce themselves in the chat; you participate by just fishing!

In 2023, tournaments focus on the wilderness worlds (/general and /wild). In 2024, we will try to unlock this feature to other game types like /oneblock and /skyblock.

You can see a fishing tournament is active when there is a bossbar message on the top of the screen. You can also type `/fisht info` to see the progress.

Rewards are paid to the top 3.

There are a handful of types of fishing tournaments; we try to rotate between them.
