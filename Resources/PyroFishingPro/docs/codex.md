## Custom Fish
In 2023, we have over a 100 custom fish from the plugin PyroFishingPro; they all have the same traits such as 'can be caught 24/7' and 'available in all biomes'. They also don't mind what weather it is or what depth they only spawn in.

In 2024, we're slowly going to customize a few of these fish to only appear under certain biomes, weather, and/or other conditions.

Players can find out more about the available fish in the `/fish codex`.
