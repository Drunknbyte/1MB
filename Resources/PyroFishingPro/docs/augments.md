## Augments and Custom Enchantments
We have custom enchantments for Fishing Rods using a Cauldron, enhancing your fishing abilities with effects like summoning tornadoes or increasing fish yield.

These are realized by creating augments.

Augments are custom enchantments specific to fishing rods only. You can view a list of augments in-game by typing `/fish augments`. To apply a fish augment, type `/fish augment` and put the fishing rod and the augment into the GUI, click the Confirm button and that's it!

Each augment has a unique purpose, crafting recipe, and max enhancement level. Each augment will require a certain fishing level (the plugin's level, NOT MCMMO) and a certain amount of entropy.
