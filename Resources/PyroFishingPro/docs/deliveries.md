## Deliveries
You can see `/fish deliveries` as mini-quests. Go catch custom fish (from different regions), earning you rewards for your efforts.

You have a `/fish bag` where you can temporarily store your fish. However, we recommend creating a separate storage system for deliveries and keeping track of what you need. This turns fishing from catch and sell, to catch and collect, yielding a bigger payout.

Deliveries are earned from every 180 custom fish that you catch. Please note this is ONLY Custom Fish. Regular fish do not count towards this amount.
