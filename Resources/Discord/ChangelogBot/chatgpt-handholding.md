Here's my changelog.py, please analyse it and let me know if I've overlooked something, did something wrong, feel free to make suggestions. Please understand I suck at all of this. ktnx <3 ur bestie.

Your draft for `changelog.py` is well-structured and includes a lot of useful comments that clarify your intentions. However, there are a few key points and small corrections that can help improve your script's functionality and clarity. Here’s a comparison along with suggestions for improvements:

### Corrections and Suggestions

1. **Batch Fetching**:
   - In your while loop, you should fetch messages from the channel using the `channel.history()` method. This was missing in your placeholder for fetching batch messages. Here’s how you should write it:
     ```python
     batch = await channel.history(limit=100, before=last_message_id).flatten()
     ```

2. **Indentation**:
   - Python is sensitive to indentation. Ensure that the body of the `while True:` loop is indented correctly (i.e., using either spaces or tabs consistently). The `while` loop and the `try` block should align properly.

3. **File Writing Mode**:
   - You're using `"w"` mode for opening the JSON file, which will overwrite the file every time. If you want to keep appending to it, consider using `"a"` mode and reading existing content if needed. However, since you're fetching all messages in one run, using `"w"` is acceptable.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - In your exception block, you might want to log the `retry_after` value from the exception if it exists, to better understand how long to wait before retrying:
     ```python
     await asyncio.sleep(e.retry_after / 1000.0 if hasattr(e, 'retry_after') else 10)
     ```

5. **Final Print Statement**:
   - Your print statement for completed fetching is missing the actual filename variable. It should use the constant instead of using a string literal:
     ```python
     print(f"All messages fetched from discord and saved to {OUTPUT_JSON_FILENAME}.")
     ```

6. **Closing the Bot**:
   - The line `await bot.close()` cannot be used directly outside of an asynchronous function. You should call this at the end of your `on_ready()` event instead of outside of any function.

7. **Final Structure**:
   - Your overall structure is good, but ensure the code follows the correct Python syntax for asynchronous operations. 

### Summary of Changes
- Fixed the message fetching part.
- Adjusted indentation and improved the error handling.
- Corrected the print statement to include the filename constant.
- Properly moved the `await bot.close()` call into the `on_ready()` function.

These adjustments should help ensure your script runs smoothly and is easy to understand for other developers. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!
