&3About Salvage:\n&eSalvage allows you to use a gold block to salvage armor and\n&etools.\n\n&3XP GAIN:\n&eSalvage is a child skill of Repair and Fishing, your Salvage\n&eskill level is based on your Fishing and Repair skill levels.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 1

```
&3How can I use Salvage?\n&ePlace down a mcMMO Salvage Anvil and right-click to salvage\n&ethe item you're currently holding. This will break apart the item,\n&eand give back materials used to craft the item.\n\n&eFor example, salvaging an iron pickaxe will give you iron bars.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 2

```
&3How does Advanced Salvage work?\n&eWhen unlocked, this ability allows you to salvage damaged items.\n&eThe yield percentage increases as you level up. A higher yield\n&emeans that you can get more materials back.\n&eWith advanced salvage you will always get 1 material back,\n&eunless the item is too damaged. So you don't have to worry\n&eabout destroying items without getting anything in return.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 3

```
&3To illustrate how this works, here's an example:\n&eLet's say we salvage a gold pickaxe which is damaged for 20%,\n&ethis means that the maximum amount you could get is only 2\n&e(because the pick is crafted with 3 ingots - each worth\n&e33,33% durability) which is equal to 66%. If your yield\n&epercentage is below 66% you are not able to get 2 ingots.\n&eIf it is above this value you are able to gain the "full amount",\n&ewhich means that you will get 2 ingots.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 4

```
&3How does Arcane Salvage work?\n&eThis ability allows you to get enchanted books when salvaging\n&eenchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of\n&esuccessfully extracting a full or partial enchantment varies.\n\n&eWhen an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment\n&ebook will have a lower level enchantment compared to what\n&eit was on the item.
