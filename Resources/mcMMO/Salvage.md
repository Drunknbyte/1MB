```

## Guides Salvage Section 1

```
How can I use Salvage?
Place down a mcMMO Salvage Anvil and right-click to salvage
the item you're currently holding. This will break apart the item,
and give back materials used to craft the item.

For example, salvaging an iron pickaxe will give you iron bars.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 2

```
How does Advanced Salvage work?
When unlocked, this ability allows you to salvage damaged items.
The yield percentage increases as you level up. A higher yield
means that you can get more materials back.
With advanced salvage you will always get 1 material back,
unless the item is too damaged. So you don't have to worry
about destroying items without getting anything in return.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 3

```
To illustrate how this works, here's an example:
Let's say we salvage a gold pickaxe which is damaged for 20%,
this means that the maximum amount you could get is only 2
(because the pick is crafted with 3 ingots - each worth
33,33% durability) which is equal to 66%. If your yield
percentage is below 66% you are not able to get 2 ingots.
If it is above this value you are able to gain the "full amount",
which means that you will get 2 ingots.
```

## Guides Salvage Section 4

```
How does Arcane Salvage work?
This ability allows you to get enchanted books when salvaging
enchanted items. Depending on your level the chance of
successfully extracting a full or partial enchantment varies.

When an enchantment is partially extracted, the enchantment
book will have a lower level enchantment compared to what
it was on the item.
