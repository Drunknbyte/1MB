How does Blast Mining work?
Blast Mining is an ability with a cooldown tied to the Mining
skill. It gives bonuses when mining with TNT and allows you
to remote detonate TNT. There are three parts to Blast Mining.
The first part is Bigger Bombs, which increases blast radius.
The second is Demolitions Expert, which decreases damage
from TNT explosions. The third part simply increases the
amount of ores dropped from TNT and decreases the
debris dropped.
