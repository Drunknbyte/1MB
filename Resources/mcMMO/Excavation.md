# mcMMO Excavation

The Excavation skill is the act of digging with a shovel. As the skill levels up, you get a higher chance of receiving treasures from what you dig.


## Increasing skill level

You level up by digging specific blocks with a shovel.

If you really want a high level in Excavation, just go far from your home and dig everything in sight that's listed to the right.

## Super Ability

Giga Drill Breaker is an ability activated by right-clicking a shovel before immediately digging after.

It adds 5 levels of Efficiency to the held shovel for a brief duration of time.

The duration lasts two seconds, lasting an extra second for every 50 levels you have in Excavation.

A drawback is that durability drains twice as fast during Giga Drill Breaker.

## Active Ability

Excavation only has one 'Active Ability' currently.

That ability is Archaeology.

How does Archaeology work?
Every possible treasure for Excavation has its own
skill level requirement for it to drop, as a result it's
difficult to say how much it is helping you.
Just keep in mind that the higher your Excavation skill
is, the more treasures that can be found.
And also keep in mind that each type of Excavation
compatible material has its own unique list of treasures.
In other words you will find different treasures in Dirt
than you would in Gravel.
