## SubSkills

Active subskills require you to do something in order to trigger the skill.

### Ice Fishing

Level Requirement: 5 (50)

Allows you to fish in icy biomes.

### Shake

Level Requirement: 15 (150)

Shake items off of mobs or players with your fishing pole.

On mobs this will damage them for 1/4 of their total health. Starting in mcmmo 2.2 this has an upper limit of 10 damage. This means that a mob with over 40 health (20 hearts) will at most have 5 hearts removed every shake. This is only useful for servers with custom boss mobs and does not change anything for normal gameplay.

Below: Passive subskills apply their effects as soon as they are learned.

### Treasure Hunter

Level Requirement: 10 (100)

Treasure Hunter allows you find unique treasures while fishing. It is paired with Magic Hunter to also give enchanted items.

Each treasure is organized into one of six categories:

- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Epic
- Legendary
- Mythic

### Master Angler

Level Requirement: 15 (150)

Improves your chance of getting a bite while fishing.

### Fisherman's Diet

Level Requirement: 20 (200)

Improves the hunger restored from eating fish.

### Magic Hunter

Level Requirement: 20 (200)
