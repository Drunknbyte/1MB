## Acrobatics SubSkill Roll Mechanics

```
Rolling is an active Sub-Skill with a passive component.
Whenever you take fall damage you have a chance to completely negate the damage based on your skill level, at level {6}% you have a x% chance to prevent damage, and x% if you activate Graceful Roll.
The chance for success is scaled against your skill level in a linear curve until level x where it maxes out, every level in Acrobatics gives you a x% chance to succeed.
By holding the sneak button you can double your odds to avoid fall damage and avoid up to twice the fall damage! Holding sneak will transform a normal roll into a Graceful Roll.
Rolling will only prevent up to {4} damage. Graceful Rolls will prevent up to {5} damage.

How does Rolling work?
You have a passive chance when you take fall damage
to negate the damage done. You can hold the sneak button to
double your chances during the fall.
This triggers a Graceful Roll instead of a standard one.
Graceful Rolls are like regular rolls but are twice as likely to
occur and provide more damage safety than regular rolls.
Rolling chance is tied to your skill level
```

## Guides Acrobatics Section 2

```
How does Dodge work?
Dodge is a passive chance when you are
injured in combat to halve the damage taken.
It is tied to your skill level.
