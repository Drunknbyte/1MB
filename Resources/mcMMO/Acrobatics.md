## Acrobatics SubSkill Roll Mechanics
`&7Rolling is an active Sub-Skill with a passive component.\nWhenever you take fall damage you have a chance to completely negate the damage based on your skill level, at level &e{6}%&7 you have a &e{0}%&7 chance to prevent damage, and &e{1}%&7 if you activate Graceful Roll.\nThe chance for success is scaled against your skill level in a linear curve until level &e{2}&7 where it maxes out, every level in Acrobatics gives you a &e{3}%&7 chance to succeed.\nBy holding the sneak button you can double your odds to avoid fall damage and avoid up to twice the fall damage! Holding sneak will transform a normal roll into a Graceful Roll.\nRolling will only prevent up to &c{4}&7 damage. Graceful Rolls will prevent up to &a{5}&7 damage.`

`&3How does Rolling work?\n&eYou have a passive chance when you take fall damage\n&eto negate the damage done. You can hold the sneak button to\n&edouble your chances during the fall.\n&eThis triggers a Graceful Roll instead of a standard one.\n&eGraceful Rolls are like regular rolls but are twice as likely to\n&eoccur and provide more damage safety than regular rolls.\n&eRolling chance is tied to your skill level`
## Guides Acrobatics Section 2
`&3How does Dodge work?\n&eDodge is a passive chance when you are\n&einjured in combat to halve the damage taken.\n&eIt is tied to your skill level.`
