  command-sender:
    # Makes a fake sender with the "sender" name. this might break stuff that uses the CMI event any more deeply than .getName()
    # It does however allow not having the message being sent back to Discord, by checking the sender class
    - spoofed
    # If the player is currently online with their linked account, uses their player as the command sender
    - player
    # Uses the console command sender. better compatibility, worse usability
    - console
    # Uses a null command sender. supported (ish), as this is what a staffmsg from Bungeecord would send. not recommended, might break the event
    - nil
